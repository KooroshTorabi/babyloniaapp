### Who we are?

I am supernova, me and my friend bamzi started this after we have been scammed by a so called #DeFi #YieldFarming platform. We had so many plans in mind, and also hurt by ingenuity and dark intentions of people with talent, so-called developers and programmers to con people, who are mostly less informed and most vulnerable. We said, why are we not making a platform? It doesn't seem hard!! And I said we make it right, we bring games, we offer use cases, we offer transparency and honesty. Also, we make lots of money. So, we started gathering information and teaming up with professionals. What you see here is the result of daily hard work of few people who put their free time, and own money, to pursue their passion, try to run things better and at the end of the day make an honest earning. All of us have daily jobs, maybe like you, having family and love ones, and in our spare time work on babylonia.app. We do not want to get rich out of misery of others, like many others in this crypto-verse. I am not intended to create and mint tokens that are based on nothing more than polluted city air and some empty promises and lab lab lab in the white paper. In babylonia.app we are as transparent as it gets in a business, and we try that nobody gets out of this hurt or unhappy. Sharing the earning and wealth with everyone and seeking win-win conditions is always our goal. We are open to criticize, and we listen to people, investors and gamers. I will not ban you from the chatroom or the website if you tell me "fuck you and this sucks, you are a fraud!", I will answer what happened? What went wrong? We reason with you, unless your intention is to troll and hurt the platform without positive construction. Soon after we get established, we will go with full KYC-confirmed identification. Just give us a few months until we get things right, complete our team and get a permanent location. I thank you in advance for being with us. Have Fun!

### Where was Babylonia?

Babylonia was a glorious state found about 4000 years ago. It was located at the southeast of old Persia. At its heart, the city of Babylon became a city of beautiful and lavish buildings after a few centuries. The king of Babylon, Hammurabi, turned it into a rich, powerful and influential city. He created one of the worldâ€™s earliest and most complete written legal codes. Known as the Code of Hammurabi, it helped Babylon surpass other cities in the region. Babylon was the largest city in the world, the first city to reach a population above 200,000.

The wealth and profits must be distributed fairly. The total net profits of the babylonia.app can not be exceeded more than 5% of revenues after the taxes and calculated costs. That means simply, 95% of generated revenue must be returned to the players and users directly or indirectly in the form of consolidation of price or platform. The performance and characteristics of the platform must be judged and weighed according to the actions, not upon the words and promises. Honesty and being transparent has the highest value. That means every change, update, delay and failure must be announced and discussed with the citizens and community immediately. The constant improvement and optimization is the path to go forward. Babylonian does not afraid of making changes, it is understood that mistakes can be made, but important is to fix the errors from the lessons learned.

The states must be designed and run to fulfil the purpose which giving love and making everyone happy. Babylonia is a private entity, the government is autonomous and runs on dÃ©marche. The power of capital and will of citizens must be calculated fairly. The power will not be inherited to families and friends unless to be proved worthy by design, but it is not recommended. The opinion of leadership and vote of people must be respected even if it is seemed to be wrong. The short answer is no. We try to be innovating and bring new staff all the time to the market. However, we are just a few enthusiasts getting together to run the project and our budget and capabilities are limited. Therefore, we try to maximize what we can obtain from the free and public contents on the internet. Anything goes, from GitHub to Turbosquid.
