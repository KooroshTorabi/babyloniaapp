# Dots and Boxes

The game starts with an empty grid of dots. Usually, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two free adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1Ã—1  box earns one point and takes another turn. A point is typically recorded by placing a mark that identifies the player in the box, such as an initial. The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner is the player with the most points. Will be available in 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 configurations.
