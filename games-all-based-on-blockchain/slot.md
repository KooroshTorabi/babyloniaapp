# Slot

Slots games are most common what you may find in any casino, bar or diner. It is extremely easy to play only pushing one two buttons, quick to finish and repeat in just matter of few seconds and extremely entertaining with flashy animation and fun sounds. However, the problem with slot games are 1\ the winning algorithm is not transparent for the player, 2\ it is very intimidating and therefore player can lose large amount of money in short amount of time, and 3\ finally it's running too fast for blockhash to keep up, even with a fast blockchain like BSC, with the block time about 3\ seconds, the system cannot acquire the random number from the block. So the only implementation of a slot game will be on the transaction and payment side, not in the game itself. What we're trying to do here in babylonia.app is to bring authentic in house develop slot games. When possible, we utilize what is available on the web, free to use or reproduce for our purpose. After things get going, and we have enough funds, we could get licensed slot games too, or maybe do a collaboration with people and other platforms to bring all kind of goodies to the Babylonia. Why we are doing that? Simple, we are not crooks, we do not steal content, codes and properties of others in the name of anonymous developers, or because it's just internet and everyone else does it. Talking about algorithm and win chances, we are following casino game standards, based on the game can vary slightly.
