# BabyFOMO

BabyFOMO is a mash-up of the “no-loss lottery” concept mixed with a classic “Fomo3D” jackpot game which rewards players for buying the last key before the timer runs out, unlocking the jackpot reward! So how does Fomo work? The game revolves around Chips and the timer, players spend Chips which give them a slice of the jackpot if they’re one of the last five to spend their Chips before the timer hits zero. Each 100 Chips adds time to the clock, extending the round for more action! This starts at 30 mins per 100 Chips spent, but decreases as the round goes on. Once the timer finally hits zero, the current round will end, and the last five Chips spenders in the round will split the jackpot reward (a big pile of Chips) based on how many Chips they spent. An example: Jackpot is 100,000 Chips and player 1 spent 1000 Chips whilst player 2 only spent 100 Chips, this means player 1 will receive 90000 Chips and player 2 will only receive 10000 Chips!
