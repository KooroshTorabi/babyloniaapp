# Blockchain Roulette

Everybody who played in a casino knows about the roulette. In the classic roulette game, a player may choose to place a bet on a single number, various groupings of numbers, the color red or black, whether the number is odd or even, or if the numbers are high (19–36) or low (1–18). To determine the winning number, a dealer spins a wheel in one direction, then spins a ball in the opposite direction around a tilted circular track running around the outer edge of the wheel. The ball eventually loses momentum, passes through an area of deflectors, and falls onto the wheel and into one of the colored and numbered pockets on the wheel. The winnings are then paid to anyone who has placed a successful bet. There are various roulette type out there, the classic roulette may have 37, 38 or 39 numbers. In our blockchain roulette, the random numbers are being produces by the blockhash, and the timestamp will be registered, the deceleration factor will be fixed variables dependent on the chosen surface, and the speed and acceleration of the wheel will be determined by the player or to be chosen automatically. The simplified formula will be published and all the results are verifiable by the players.
