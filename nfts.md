# 🎴 NFTs

Everyone knows about **NFTs**, they are all over the web, we use **NFTs** for two **purposes**:&#x20;

1/ As a utility token, to offer benefits and extra features to the player, features like offering extra chance to win the game, or buying tickets to the games at a discounted rate. Also people can later on add profile photos or avatars, choose usernames, all will be saved as a minted NFT on the blockchain, player buy these kinds of NFTs, and they are transferrable.&#x20;

2/ As achievable prize 🏆 and trophy after winning certain number of games, or being on the platform for some amount of time. Later on we are planning to have competitions and multiplayer games and tournaments, these collected NFTs might come handy. Achievable kind of NFTs can not be transferred or to be bought.
