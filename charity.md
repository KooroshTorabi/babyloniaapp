# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³ Charity

At this moment, 1.5% of total profits of the babylonia.app + 1% of every transaction fees on BSC blockchain before the potential taxes will be dedicated to charity. The ratios are subjected to change. The donations will be sent thorough the designated cryptocurrencies.&#x20;

Yes, we know, nobody has done it this way, but we plan to pay back to the community as much as we can even if it is only a few dollars.

The charity & donation section will be available, up and running as soon as we after the main launch phase. The updates will be posted on the logs.
